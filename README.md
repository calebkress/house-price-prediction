# Austin House Price Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for a web application that uses Machine Learning regression techniques to predict house prices in the Austin area. Users can input house data, and the application will provide a price prediction based on the trained model.

## Features

- Predict House Prices: Users can input house data, and the application will use a trained regression model to provide an estimated price.

- User-Friendly Interface: The web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for anyone to use.

- Data Visualization: Users can explore data visualizations to understand the relationships between different features and house prices.

## Demo

The project is live at (project url) - please click here (link to project) for a live demo.

(TODO: Add links to frontend when complete)

## Installation

To run this project locally, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calebkress/austin-house-price-prediction.git
cd austin-house-price-prediction
```

## Usage

1. Open the web application in your web browser.

2. Fill out the form with details about the house you want to predict the price for.

3. Click the "Predict" button to see the estimated house price.

4. Explore data visualizations to gain insights into the relationship between different features and house prices.

## Data

The dataset used to train the Machine Learning model can be found in the data directory. It includes historical information about houses in the Austin area, such as size, number of bedrooms, location, and actual sale prices.

(TODO: Add this once dataset is sanitized + complete)

## Machine Learning Models

The Machine Learning models used for house price prediction are included in the models directory. They have been trained on the provided dataset and can make accurate predictions based on the features of a house.

(TODO: Add once models are complete + trained)

## Web Application

The web application is built using React, a JavaScript web framework. The main application code is located in the App.js file within the house-prediction folder. 

(TODO: Complete web app + upload code)
