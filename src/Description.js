  <h2>Linear Regression Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable
    and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The objective is to
    find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values of the
    dependent variable. In simpler terms, it quantifies the linear relationship between variables, allowing
    us to understand how changes in one variable correlate with changes in another. In the context of a house
    market prediction model, these variables might include factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms,
    and other relevant features that influence the market value of a property.

  <h2>Predicting Future House Prices</h2>
  <p>
    In the realm of house market prediction, linear regression is a powerful tool for forecasting future prices
    based on historical data. By analyzing patterns and relationships between various features and house prices,
    the model establishes a mathematical equation that represents these connections. Once trained, the regression
    model can then be used to predict the future price of houses with a certain degree of confidence. This predictive
    capability is invaluable for real estate stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions on pricing,
    investment, and market trends. Whether assisting buyers in making budget-conscious choices or aiding sellers
    in strategically pricing their properties, linear regression empowers the industry with a data-driven approach
    to anticipate and navigate the dynamics of the housing market.

  <h2>Random Forest in House Price Prediction</h2>
  <p>
    Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time
    and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees. It is particularly effective for regression tasks
    like house price prediction because it can handle a large number of features and is less likely to overfit than
    individual decision trees. By evaluating various features of a property, such as location, size, and condition,
    Random Forest can capture complex nonlinear relationships that may be overlooked by linear methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    When applied to house price prediction, Random Forest considers the input features (predictors) of many houses and
    learns to predict the price by looking at the known outcomes. It does so by creating a 'forest' of decision trees
    where each tree votes on the final price, and the average of these votes is taken as the final prediction. This
    process not only improves the accuracy of the prediction but also provides insights into the importance of each
    feature in determining house prices. As a result, stakeholders can gain a multi-faceted understanding of the factors
    driving the housing market, leading to better investment strategies and market analysis.
