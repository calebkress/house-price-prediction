      <h2>Linear Regression Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable
        and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The objective is to
        find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values of the
        dependent variable. In simpler terms, it quantifies the linear relationship between variables, allowing
        us to understand how changes in one variable correlate with changes in another. In the context of a house
        market prediction model, these variables might include factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms,
        and other relevant features that influence the market value of a property.

      <h2>Predicting Future House Prices</h2>
      <p>
        In the realm of house market prediction, linear regression is a powerful tool for forecasting future prices
        based on historical data. By analyzing patterns and relationships between various features and house prices,
        the model establishes a mathematical equation that represents these connections. Once trained, the regression
        model can then be used to predict the future price of houses with a certain degree of confidence. This predictive
        capability is invaluable for real estate stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions on pricing,
        investment, and market trends. Whether assisting buyers in making budget-conscious choices or aiding sellers
        in strategically pricing their properties, linear regression empowers the industry with a data-driven approach
        to anticipate and navigate the dynamics of the housing market.
